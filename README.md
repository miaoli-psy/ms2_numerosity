## Paper Abstract

Humans can estimate the number of visually presented items without counting. This ability refers as to numerosity perception. In most many numerosity studies, items are uniformly distributed across displays, with identical distributions in central and eccentric parts. However, our visual performance differs between the fovea and the periphery, and the visual field is highly asymmetric in regard to interferences between items. One of such asymmetries is the radial-tangential anisotropy: items arranged radially interfere more strongly with each other than items arranged tangentially. This has been shown for crowding (the deleterious effect when identifying targets in clutter) and redundancy masking where items in repeating patterns are not detected. In the present studies, we tested how the radial-tangential anisotropy of spatial vision impacts numerosity perception. In four experiments, we presented participants displays with varying number of discs that were predominantly arranged radially or tangentially, forming strong and weak interference conditions, respectively. Participants were required to report the number of discs on the display. We found that observers reported the radial displays as less numerous than the tangential displays for all radial-tangential manipulations: weak (Experiment 1), strong (Experiment 2), and modulated with mixed contrast polarity (Experiment 3 and Experiment 4). Our results showed a radial-tangential anisotropy of numerosity perception. We suggested that crowding and redundancy masking modulate the numerosity perception.
